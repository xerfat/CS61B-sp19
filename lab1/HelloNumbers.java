    // In Java, variables have specific type, which can never change. This is called static typing
    /*
    1. Before Java variables can be used, they must be declared.
    2. Java variables must have a specific type.
    3. Java variables can never change.
    4. Types are verified before the code even runs !!! (different from Python)
